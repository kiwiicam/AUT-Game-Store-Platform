# AUT Gamestore Platform

This github repository is for a project for final year students at AUT, our project is to create a game store platform for game programming students to be able to upload and display their games for everyone worldwide to be able to view, download and play these games.

We are creating this project for a client within AUT who has given us this as a project and gave us a list of features and an idea of what he wants, from there we went and created the AUT gamestore platform.
